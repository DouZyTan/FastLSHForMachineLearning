# FastLSHForMachineLearningTasks

FastLSH is achieved in three machine learning tasks, i.e., ANN search, anomaly detection and neural network training. The source codes are placed in the matching folders. For ANN search, FastLSH is achieved under E2LSH package and LSHKIT (used to run MPLSH). For E2LSH package, reader can refer to the website http://web.mit.edu/andoni/www/LSH/index.html to install this package. To run FastLSH, one can conduct the command of bin/lsh_fromParams dataFile queryFile parametersFile groundtruthFile. For our experiments, the parametersFile for 12 datasets is given. For LSHKIT, reader can refer to the website https://lshkit.sourceforge.net/index.html to install this package. For anomaly dection, please refer to https://github.com/rackingroll/ace, while for reural network, please refer to https://github.com/sarthakpati/HashingDeepLearning.
