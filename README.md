# FastLSHForMachineLearningTasks

The effectiveness of FastLSH is evaluated in three machine learning tasks, i.e., ANN search, anomaly detection and neural network training. The source codes are placed in the corresponding folders, i.e., ANN search, Anomaly Detection and Neural Network Training. In all these tasks, hash functions are replaced by FastLSH for comparison. 

For E2LSH package and LSHKIT (MPLSH), please refer to http://web.mit.edu/andoni/www/LSH/index.html and https://lshkit.sourceforge.net/index.html for installation and usage information. For anomaly detection task, please refer to https://github.com/rackingroll/ace for detailed instructions, and the usage information for neural network training is at https://github.com/sarthakpati/HashingDeepLearning.
